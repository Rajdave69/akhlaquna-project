## What does being hacked mean?

Being hacked means that someone has gained access to your computer or network without your permission.
This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in your system or by tricking you into giving them access. 
Once they have access, they can do anything they want with your computer or network, including stealing 
your data, deleting your files, or using your computer to attack other people.


## What to do if you think you've been hacked

It's a scary thought, but it's a reality: at some point in our online lives, we may 
fall victim to a hack. Whether it's a personal email account or a business website, 
being hacked can be a stressful and overwhelming experience. But fear not! There are 
steps you can take to minimize the damage and protect yourself in the future. Here are 
the steps to take when you've been hacked, as well as some tips on how to prevent it 
from happening in the first place.

1. Identify the extent of the hack. The first step is to determine the scope of the hack 
and what has been compromised. This may involve reviewing your accounts and devices to 
see what information has been accessed or changed. It's important to do this as soon as 
possible to minimize the amount of damage that can be done.

2. Change your passwords. One of the most important steps you can take after being hacked is 
to change all of your passwords, especially for any accounts that may have been compromised. 
This includes email accounts, social media accounts, and any other accounts that may be connected 
to your personal information. Use a unique and strong password for each account, and consider 
using a password manager to help you keep track of them.

3. Enable two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of 
security to your accounts by requiring you to provide a second form of authentication, such 
as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. This makes it much harder for a 
hacker to gain access to your accounts, even if they have your password. Enable 2FA on all of 
your accounts that offer it.

4. Update your software and security measures. Make sure all of your software, including your 
operating system and any security software, is up to date. Hackers often exploit vulnerabilities 
in outdated software to gain access to your systems, so keeping your software up to date is an 
important way to protect yourself.

5. Monitor your accounts and credit reports. Keep an eye on your accounts and credit reports for any 
unusual activity. This can help you identify any additional damage that may have been done by the 
hack and allow you to take action to remedy the situation.

6. Seek help if necessary. If the hack was particularly severe or if you're not sure how to proceed, 
consider seeking help from a professional. This could be a cyber-security expert or a lawyer, 
depending on the specifics of the situation.

## Prevention

Now that we've covered what to do if you've been hacked, let's talk about how to prevent it from 
happening in the first place. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:

1. Use strong and unique passwords. As mentioned earlier, using strong and unique passwords for each 
of your accounts is crucial for protecting yourself online. Avoid using the same password for multiple 
accounts, and consider using a password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords.

2. Enable two-factor authentication. As mentioned above, 2FA is a valuable tool for protecting your accounts. 
Make sure to enable it on all of your accounts that offer it.

3. Keep your software up to date. As mentioned earlier, keeping your software up to date is important for 
protecting yourself from vulnerabilities that hackers may exploit. Make sure to install updates as soon 
as they become available.

4. Be cautious when clicking on links. Hackers often use phishing attacks to trick people into clicking on 
malicious links that can infect their devices with malware. Be cautious when clicking on links, especially 
if you didn't expect to receive them or if they seem suspicious.

5. Use a reputable antivirus program. An antivirus program can help protect your device from malware and other 
threats by scanning your
